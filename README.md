## Title: ReciPosts
## Introduction
ReciPosts is a mobile application that catalogues a variety of food recipes that are updated by the official ReciPosts team, or by community members that want to share their own recipes. The ReciPosts app is unique amongst other recipe mobile apps in that recipes for a particular dish are all consolidated into one recipe, with each variation that is posted integrated into that single recipe where users can browse through the variations and ingredient changes of the recipe in a single page. Users for example can easily configure the recipe output so that it can be vegan, dairy free, meat free, and much more.
ReciPosts envisions to be GitHub for recipes, where users do not have to go through different sites and recipes to find the exact recipe for their preference.
## Objective
Provide a platform to browse and share recipes that are tailored for their preference with robust options.
## Features
- Browse recipe catalogue 
- Search and filter recipes based on ingredients, region, poster
